# Cluster

Cluster is your solution for classroom polling. Set up a cluster for your class to get direct feedback on lectures, find out how students are feeling, and check student understanding at the tap of a button!

While nothing can replace in-person learning, we can do our best to close the loop so teachers know what students are feeling. Teaching becomes much more effective when the teacher can know what students are feeling during a class.
